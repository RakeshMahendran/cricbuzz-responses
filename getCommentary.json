India were handed out heart shattering losses in the first two ODIs but they have risen from it like a phoenix and have handed the hosts a pasting. It was all about Kishan. Superlatives and adjectives will be adorning his name today. But for India, they will need a few quick fixes as the next fifty overs WC ain't too far away given there would be Tests, T20Is and an IPL sandwiched before that. Over to some attritional red ball cricket now or there would be some bazball adventure as well? That's it from our team of B0$ This isB1$ signing off. Toodles.",
